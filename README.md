🎬 Hey, I’m Rancid Tomatillos!

# 🍅 Overview

Nice to meet you! I’m a React-powered movie app, here to help you browse films, check out details, and enjoy a seamless experience. My creators built me to flex their React skills, work with APIs, master React Router, and test things out with Cypress. Pretty cool, right?

# 🎥 What I Can Do
	•	Show you a hand-picked (okay, API-fetched) list of movies
	•	Give you detailed info on any movie you click
	•	Let you navigate smoothly between pages with React Router
	•	Adapt to any screen size so I look great everywhere
	•	Ensure quality control with Cypress testing

# 🛠️ My Tech Stack
	•	React (because I love being dynamic)
	•	JavaScript (ES6+) (for those sleek, modern touches)
	•	React Router (so you don’t get lost)
	•	Cypress (making sure I work like a charm)
	•	HTML & CSS (because I need to look good too)

# 🚀 How to Get Me Running

## Prerequisites

### Before we hang out, make sure you have:
	•	Node.js (latest stable version)
	•	npm or yarn (I’m flexible!)

### Steps to Install & Run
	1.	Clone me to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/JarenGarman/rancid-tomatillos.git  


	2.	Enter my directory like stepping into a theater: 
   `cd rancid-tomatillos`


	3.	Install my dependencies (I need my essentials!):

`npm install`


	4.	Start me up and let’s go:

`npm start`


	5.	Open me in your browser: http://localhost:3000/

## 🧪 Running Tests

Wanna make sure I’m working smoothly? Run my tests with:

`npx cypress open`

Then just pick a test and let it roll! 🎬

### 🎭 How to Use Me
	•	When you open me up, I’ll greet you with a grid of movies.
	•	Click a movie poster to see all the juicy details.
	•	Need to go back? No problem—just use my navigation UI.

### 🔮 My Future Plans

### I’m always looking to improve! Here’s what I’d love to add:
	•	User authentication (so I can recognize you!)
	•	Better accessibility & performance optimizations
	•	More API integrations for even richer movie details
