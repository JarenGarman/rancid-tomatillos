⸻

🎬 Hey, I’m [Rancid Tomatillos](https://rancid-tomatillos-6a1f347e610e.herokuapp.com/)!

## 🍅 Overview

Nice to meet you! I’m a React-powered movie app, here to help you browse films, check out details, and enjoy a seamless experience. My creators built me to flex their React skills, work with APIs, master React Router, and test things out with Cypress. Pretty cool, right?

### 🎥 What I Can Do

- Show you a hand-picked (okay, API-fetched) list of movies
- Give you detailed info on any movie you click
- Let you navigate smoothly between pages with React Router
- Adapt to any screen size so I look great everywhere
- Ensure quality control with Cypress testing

### 🛠️ My Tech Stack

- React (because I love being dynamic)
- JavaScript (ES6+) (for those sleek, modern touches)
- React Router (so you don’t get lost)
- Cypress (making sure I work like a charm)
- HTML & CSS (because I need to look good too)

## 🚀 How to Get Me Running

### Prerequisites

#### Before we hang out, make sure you have

- Node.js (latest stable version)
- npm or yarn (I’m flexible!)

### Steps to Install & Run

1. Clone me to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/JarenGarman/rancid-tomatillos.git`
2. Enter my directory like stepping into a theater: `cd rancid-tomatillos`
3. Install my dependencies (I need my essentials!): `npm install`
4. Start me up and let’s go: `npm start`
5. Open me in your browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🧪 Running Tests

Wanna make sure I’m working smoothly? Run my tests with: `npx cypress open`

Then just pick a test and let it roll! 🎬

## 🎭 How to Use Me

- When you open me up, I’ll greet you with a grid of movies.
- Click a movie poster to see all the juicy details.
- Need to go back? No problem—just use my navigation UI.

## 🔮 My Future Plans

### I’m always looking to improve! Here’s what I’d love to add

- User authentication (so I can recognize you!)
- Better accessibility & performance optimizations
- More API integrations for even richer movie details
